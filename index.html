        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a Computer Science student at Parul University (2022–2026) with a CGPA of 8.0/10.
            I have a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, cloud computing, and large-scale data processing.
            I love building robust data pipelines and implementing machine learning models to solve complex
            problems.
        </p>

        <h3>Research Interest</h3>
        <p>
            My primary research interests lie in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Distributed
            Systems.
            I am particularly interested in scalable machine learning pipelines and efficient data processing
            architectures.
        </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
            I love experimenting with new technologies and learning new things. I am a quick learner and can
            pick up
            new skills
            with ease. I am also a team player and enjoy working in a collaborative environment. Eventhough I
            love
            to use different
            languages and frameworks, I love working on Google cloud platform and Vertex AI.
        </p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I love to travel and explore new places. I also enjoy reading books and watching movies. I am also a
            big
            fan of
            music and love to listen to different genres.
